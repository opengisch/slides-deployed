# Model designer highlights
## >3.28

---

### Feature: New ‘Calculate expression’ algorithm for use in models
The new “Calculate expression” algorithm will calculate the results of a QGIS expression and make the result available for use in other parts of the model.

It avoids the need to use the same expression multiple times throughout a model if the same result needs to be used more than once and provides additional use cases (such as generating a static timestamp value for use throughout a model).

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog334/index.html#feature-new-calculate-expression-algorithm-for-use-in-models

---

### Feature: Allow configuration of the order of outputs created by a model
A new “Reorder Output Layers” action to the model designer menu has been added which allows model creators to set a specific order which the outputs from their model must use when loading the results into a project. This gives the model creator a means of ensuring that layers are logically ordered on the canvas when running a model, such as placing a vector layer output over a raster layer output, or a point layer over a polygon layer.

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog334/index.html#feature-new-calculate-expression-algorithm-for-use-in-models

---

### Feature: Set processing defaults from QGIS configuration file
QGIS now supports the capability to configure the default values for GUI tools within the QGIS Processing framework using parameters specified in the QGIS.ini settings file.
This allows for the configuration of user-specific or organization-wide default values for certain algorithms. 

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog334/index.html#feature-set-processing-defaults-from-qgis-configuration-file

---

## <= 3.28

---

### Feature: Raise message model tool
A raise message algorithm has been added to the model tools which allows users to output additional information in models logs. This prevents the abuse of the raise error/warning algorithms and provides more granular control of model logging levels.

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog326/index.html#feature-raise-message-model-tool

---

### Feature: Background processing of model algorithms
Previously, any graphical models designed in Processing would be forced to run on the main thread, and did not support background execution. QGIS now supports running model algorithms off the main thread so that they can safely be run in background tasks.

https://www2.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog326/#feature-background-processing-of-model-algorithms

---

### Feature: Run batch processing steps in tasks
Individual steps from the batch processing dialog now run as a separate task whenever possible. Although individual steps are still run sequentially rather than parallel, this keeps the UI responsive, and permits responsive cancellation and progress reporting.

https://www2.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog326/#feature-run-batch-processing-steps-in-tasks

---

### Feature: Allow setting Examples in graphical model help
A new ‘Examples’ section has been added to the graphical model help editor dialog, allowing users to enter their own custom examples to help explain usage of the model.

More instructive help is now shown for models in the qgis_process tool, including outputting any example help which has been set.

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog326/index.html#feature-allow-setting-examples-in-graphical-model-help

---

### Feature: Default option to show feature count for vector outputs from processing
A new Show feature count for output vector layers setting is available (but disabled by default for performance reasons), which will automatically enable the “show feature count” option on output layers loaded from QGIS processing. This is able to give users a first glimpse of what to expect as an output from a Processing algorithm.

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog328/index.html#feature-default-option-to-show-feature-count-for-vector-outputs-from-processing

---

### Feature: Add relations export option to package layers algorithm
The “Package Layers” processing tool now supports optionally following project relations and exporting related tables following the hierarchy both upstream and downstream, whilst also taking selected features into account.

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog328/index.html#feature-add-relations-export-option-to-package-layers-algorithm

---

### Feature: Project Models are shown in the Project menu
We added a new submenu to the “Project” menu, which will list any Processing models stored within the current project. This gives you a quick way to launch these project-specific models, in either a single or batch mode!

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog324/index.html#feature-project-models-are-shown-in-the-project-menu

---

### Feature: Processing history rework
This is a much more flexible approach to storing Processing history, as it allows us to store unlimited additional information.
 
Right clicking an entry in the log has a new option to copy the execution parameters as a “qgis_process” command line equivalent, giving you a super-easy way to generate qgis_process commands for execution in a CLI. Right clicking an entry also shows a new “Copy as JSON” option, which copies a JSON string of the input parameters and algorithm settings

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog324/index.html#feature-processing-history-rework

---

### Feature: Advanced actions in Processing dialogs
We have added new actions on the processing dialog including copy as qgis_process command, and copy/paste as JSON. 

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog324/index.html#feature-advanced-actions-in-processing-dialogs

---

### Feature: Single file exports from Atlas to PDF algorithm
You can now export an atlas layout to a single (collated) PDF file using the “Export atlas layout as PDF” processing algorithm.

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog324/index.html#feature-single-file-exports-from-atlas-to-pdf-algorithm

---

### Feature: Run Python script algorithms directly via qgis_process
The qgis_process command-line tool now supports running a Python script algorithm directly by specifying the path to the .py file, in place of an algorithm ID or model file path!

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog324/index.html#feature-run-python-script-algorithms-directly-via-qgis-process

---

### Feature: Add a POST option to the FileDownloader processing algorithm
Add a choice between performing GET or POST requests when downloading a file using the FileDownloader processing tool.

If the POST parameter is specified, some DATA can be added in the query.

This is useful in many contexts, such as for sending longer requests to the Overpass API using POST to download OSM data.
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog322/index.html#feature-add-a-post-option-to-the-filedownloader-processing-algorithm

---

### Add modeler algorithm to create directories
This algorithm allows models to create new file directories. Useful for models which have to output results to certain dynamically created paths (e.g. a folder containing the current date).

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog316/index.html#add-modeler-algorithm-to-create-directories

---

### Add modeler algorithm to set a project expression variable
Allows a model to set Project-level expression variables during execution. Especially useful with the new Export Print Layout algorithms to allow models which dynamically set variables used in a layout prior to export.

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog316/index.html#add-modeler-algorithm-to-set-a-project-expression-variable
